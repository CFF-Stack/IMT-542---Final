# IMT-542---Final

StrongLifts 5x5 Tracker & Visualizer

A modular, Python-powered system for tracking and analyzing weightlifting workouts, with a focus on the StrongLifts 5x5 program.
This project provides an **open, portable JSON-based information structure** to record, track, and visualize weightlifting workouts—specifically tailored for the **StrongLifts 5x5** program. It’s designed for **athletes, data analysts, and developers** who want full control over their fitness data—free from proprietary apps and platforms. By using clear field names and simple data types, this structure ensures **cross-platform compatibility** and easy integration into any workflow. Whether you’re an athlete tracking progress, a developer integrating data, or a researcher analyzing performance trends, this dataset is ready for you.

## Project Goals

Enable **clear data recording** for workouts (including set-level success/failure)  
Create a **structured JSON dataset** for portability and future integration  
Provide **visual insights** with progression graphs and success rates  
Ensure **sustainable tracking** across platforms, no lock-in to proprietary systems

---

#Features

## Workout Data Recording
- Interactive script `generate_workout.py` to **prompt you** for each set’s success/failure.
- **Accurate JSON logs** for each workout, stored in the `workouts/` folder.

## Visualization & Analysis
- `visualize_workouts.py` script:
  - Plots **weight progression** over time for each exercise.
  - Plots **success rates** (percent of sets completed) for quality tracking.
- **Portable, open data** —no vendor lock-in!

## Weight Progression Logic
- Increases weight **gradually** (e.g., +2.5kg or +1.25kg) only if all sets of an exercise are successful.
- **Caps** for each exercise to reflect realistic progression goals:
  - Squat: 150 kg
  - Deadlift: 189 kg
  - Bench Press: 120 kg
  - Barbell Row: 110 kg
  - Overhead Press: 85 kg
- If sets are not successful, the next workout **holds** at the same weight (future deload logic can be added!).

Workouts are stored as individual JSON files in the workouts/ directory (one per workout).

To record a new workout:

bash
Copy
Edit
python record_workout.py
You’ll be prompted for set-level success/failure and other metadata (like location and how you felt).

To visualize progress:

bash
Copy
Edit
python visualize_workouts.py
This will parse the existing JSON files and create plots for:

Weight progression for each lift

Success rates over time

Each JSON file is self-contained and can be read in any JSON-compatible tool (Python, R, JavaScript, etc.).

You can manually edit JSON files if needed—just keep the field names consistent!

# Installation

Install required Python packages:

'''pip install pandas matplotlib'''

Usage
Record a Workout
bash
Copy
Edit
'python generate_workout.py'
Prompts you to log actual set success/failure for the current workout.

Visualize Data
bash
Copy
Edit
'python visualize_workouts.py'
Generates clear plots of:

Weight progression for each lift

Success rate for your lifting consistency

Data Flow
Input: User logs workout in record_workout.py
Output: Structured JSON file saved in workouts/
Analysis: visualize_workouts.py loads these JSON files, parses them into a pandas DataFrame, and creates visual plots.
