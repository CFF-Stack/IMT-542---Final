# IMT-542---Final

Group Project Presentation and Deliverables

Github repository should contain a Readme.md file that describes your project, including any code used to download and convert the structure and any code or processes for exposing the data as a website or API
A presentation file as a PDF stored in Github that you will present in class. Focus on a summary of your project that touches on the main points described above for:
Info story or who is the user and why is it important to them
Existing structure and FAIR assessment,
How you decided to improve the structure,
What your new structure is, and
How would quality be identified and addressed
For each of the 4 project grading elements above (and found rubric below) you should have documentation from prior class assignments that you can update and upload to Github using easy to understand file naming. These artifacts are what we will use for grading.
